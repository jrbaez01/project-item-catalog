# Project: Item Catalog
With this project I learned to develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories. Also I learned how to implement a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

## Dependencies
In order to be able to run the project you will need to have installed:
 - Python 2.7

## How to run
1. Keep calm my friend.
2. Clone the source code in your local envarioment
3. Enter to the code directory and run the command: ```. installdev```
4. Now you should be ready to run the server: ```flask run```
